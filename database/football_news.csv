Brentford,"Leeds celebrated Premier League safety as Jack Harrison's 94th-minute strike gave them a 2-1 win at Brentford to escape the bottom three at Burnley's expense. Harrison's late goal sparked wild scenes among the away fans as Burnley dropped into the bottom three. Knowing they needed to better the Clarets' result owing to their vastly inferior goal difference, the pressure of their challenge weighed heavy on Leeds early on. Once they settled into the game they looked relatively comfortable against a Brentford side lacking sharpness and on a chaotic afternoon across the Premier League, moments after news filtered through that Newcastle were leading at Turf Moor they thought they had taken the lead themselves through Joe Gelhardt, only for a VAR review to deny them the opener. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Bryan Mbeumo missed presentable opportunities in either half for the hosts before a rare David Raya howler saw him scuff a pass straight to Rodrigo, who he then bundled over in the box. From 12 yards, Raphinha stepped up to send him the wrong way and leave Leeds within touching distance of safety. That survival bid was given another helping hand when Kristoffer Ajer was forced off injured after Brentford had used all three substitutes, but they still reignited Leeds' sense of angst as Sergi Canos nodded home Josh Dasilva's cross to level. He was booked for his celebrations and was soon shown a second yellow for fouling Raphinha on the halfway line, but still Leeds could not re-establish their advantage until Harrison's long-range deflected effort beat Raya in the fourth minute of injury time to guarantee their survival. Premier League table How the teams lined up Match stats Get NOW to stream big moments Brentford:Raya (5), Ajer (6), Sorensen (6), Jansson (6), Henry (6), Jensen (7), Janelt (6), Eriksen (6), Wissa (6), Toney (6), Mbeumo (5). Subs: Dasilva (6), Canos (3), Baptiste (6) Leeds: Meslier (7), Koch (7), Cooper (5), Llorente (6), Firpo (7), Phillips (7), Greenwood (6), Raphinha (7), Rodrigo (6), Harrison (8), Gelhardt (6). Subs: Struijk (6), Klich (n/a). Man of the match: Jack Harrison. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It wasn't until Harrison's last-gasp winner that Leeds' capacity travelling support could finally celebrate in the knowledge that they had a third consecutive season of Premier League football to look forward to. In the end, it wasn't quality that told but a never-say-die attitude which has underpinned Leeds' survival far more than anything else. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Harrison's goal was their fourth 90th-minute winner of the season, a tally no-one across the Premier League can match. It should have been an easier afternoon for Marsch's side, who were handed a glorious chance for the opener through Raya's mistake and then should have seen out victory when Ajer was forced off injured. But they had struggled to create in open play all afternoon, and even with a man advantage their fate appeared perilous when Canos nodded in Dasilva's cross and the knowledge one Burnley goal at Turf Moor would be enough to send them down. Even when Brentford were reduced to nine men, Raya's goal rarely appeared in serious danger until Dasilva's clearance from a last-minute corner fell for Harrison, whose 25-yard effort took a slight deflection to beat the goalkeeper inside his near post. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player This may be the way Leeds have operated in recent times, but it is not a formula Marsch wants to continue. ""I've heard this a lot about Leeds United, that we think we have to do it the hard way,"" he said after the game. ""Part of my job is to change that mentality, to say we deserve more, that we have an incredible club and team, and honestly I think it's not by accident we've scored four winners or equalisers in injury time. ""We've had belief, but we've had to earn it. I've heard this is the Leeds way, but I'm not buying into that."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A top-10 finish was the carrot for Brentford at the end of a season where they have achieved Premier League safety with relative ease, but having retained their momentum into the final weekend courtesy of back-to-back wins, they looked out of sorts across 90 minutes and failed to turn spells of first-half domination into anything more concrete. Mbeumo's two efforts aside, narrowly missing the far post when played through before the break and firing straight at Ilian Meslier moments after the restart, Canos' goal was as much as they could muster against a Leeds side with the second-worst defence in the Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Despite their underwhelming afternoon in West London, they were cheered off at the full-time whistle by the home support more than content to focus on a season where they have defied the critics and become the only one of last year's three promoted sides to remain in the division. Christian Eriksen's arrival in January has proven a major catalyst in that achievement, and after the game said: ""To be disappointed in the last game to lose is something to build up. We have been on a good run and after a few hours I think everyone will settle down and be in good mood. ""I was just happy to be back playing. To be the normal me and to play football in the Premier League again. To come back and help them stay up, I am very proud of that. It is different from where I have been before but to be here now having played good football in the last six months, I am very pleased. ""On the last day of the season, to bring your family on to the pitch, it is special. Now it is a week off and then with the national team, so a few games still to go. But first a holiday.""

Brighton And Hove Albion,"West Ham missed out on securing a Europa League place following a 3-1 defeat at Brighton despite Manchester United slipping up against Crystal Palace. The Hammers needed to win and hope United didn't in order to secure sixth place but even though Palace won 1-0, David Moyes' side will have to settle for the Europa Conference League after failing to do their bit. Michail Antonio put West Ham in front before the break with a wonderful strike that found the top corner, although Brighton hit back through defender Joel Veltman just five minutes into the second period. Then Pascal Gross matched Antonio's strike with a superb effort of his own which flew high into the net, before Danny Welbeck's injury-time header wrapped up the points and Brighton's best-ever Premier League finish. The hosts started brightly, enjoying 69 per cent of possession in the opening 15 minutes and seeing Moises Caicedo force Lukasz Fabianski into a smart save down to his left. West Ham slowly worked their way into the game, eventually having more of the ball themselves but unable to trouble the Brighton goal until Antonio produced a wonderful goal out of nothing. The away fans had only just finished celebrating Crystal Palace going ahead against Manchester United before Antonio got the better of Lewis Dunk on the edge of the Brighton area and sent a wonderful left-footed shot into the top corner. Premier League table How the teams lined up Match stats Get NOW to stream big moments Leandro Trossard was not in the Brighton squad after taking a knock against Leeds last time out. Adam Webster came into the starting line-up as part of the host's back three with Marc Cucurella moving into left wing-back. David Moyes stuck with the same 11 which held Manchester City to a thrilling 2-2 draw last weekend. Mark Noble started on the bench in what was his final game as a West Ham player. Brighton, though, hit back just five minutes into the second half, this time capitalising on another slow start from the visitors. Solly March brought down a cross inside the West Ham area and teed up Veltman, whose low drive squirmed under the body of Fabianski. The hosts then had the chance to lead as Welbeck sent an effort wide from a tight angle following tidy build-up play between Cucurella and Alexis Mac Allister. West Ham steadied themselves yet never came close to scoring with Mark Noble introduced nine minutes from time for his final appearance for the club. Brighton showed their quality as Gross swivelled on the edge of the area and fired a superb strike into the top corner to give them the lead. Only Norwich (12) had scored fewer home goals than Brighton, but Welbeck made sure they wouldn't set a new club record for fewest home goals scored by heading in from a corner during injury time. Brighton: Sanchez (7), Cucurella (7), Webster (7), Dunk (7), Bissouma (6), Mac Allister (7), Gross (8), Welbeck (8), March (8), Caicedo (7), Veltman (8). Subs: Lamptey (6), Maupay (6), Mwepu (6). West Ham: Fabianski (5), Cresswell (5), Zouma (5), Coufal (6), Fornals (6), Antonio (7), Lanzini (6), Dawson (5), Bowen (6), Soucek (6), Rice (6). Subs: Yarmolenko (n/a), Noble (n/a), Johnson (n/a) Man of the match: Joel Veltman Brighton head coach Graham Potter: ""I'm incredibly proud, it's been a fantastic group to work with, everybody behind the scenes. It's amazing for us to finish where we have. ""It hasn't been straightforward, ups and downs, but we stuck together and we can be really proud of what we've done. ""We were disappointed at half-time, didn't play to the level I think we can. A couple of adjustments and the boys were fantastic in the second half, got on the front foot a bit more and created chances. To score three goals coming back from a goal down is brilliant. It sums up their character and spirit."" West Ham manager David Moyes: ""We're pleased with how the players performed throughout the season so, disappointed today. We didn't play well, especially in the second half, but the players have done really well this year. ""You want the players to be tougher than that, we've had a lot of resilience through the year and we didn't show that in the second half when we were 1-0 up. ""We had a great chance of winning today and put ourselves in a great chance of winning but, unlike us, we didn't fulfil that and follow it through."" Brighton ended the Premier League season with 51 points, their best-ever total in the competition and second only to their 52-point haul in the top-flight in 1981-82 (3pts for a win) when they played 42 games. Michail Antonio (via his first-ever goal scored from outside the box for West Ham) is the first player to hit double figures in three consecutive top-flight seasons for the Hammers since Tony Cottee (five between 1983-84 and 1987-88), with the striker also the first player to hit 10+ goals in three Premier League campaigns for the club (10 in each of the last three seasons). Pascal Groß netted his 17th Premier League goal for Brighton, with his tally of 44 goal involvements in the competition (17 goals, 27 assists) 11 more than any other player for the Seagulls (Maupay on 33).

Burnley,"Vincent Kompany has left his role as boss of Anderlecht amid talks with Burnley about becoming the club's new manager. Kompany is on a shortlist of candidates to succeed Sean Dyche at Turf Moor and no decision has been made yet over their next manager. Kompany confirmed his departure from Anderlecht on Wednesday, with a club statement reading: ""Today only one feeling prevails: I am proud that I was able to start this new chapter at the club of my heart. I have now been a player and a coach of RSC Anderlecht, but above all I remain a loyal fan."" Burnley have been without a permanent boss since sacking Dyche in April and though caretaker manager Mike Jackson picked up 11 points from eight games in charge, he was not able to save the Clarets from relegation to the Championship on the final day of the season. Kompany was first named player-manager of Anderlecht after leaving the Etihad in 2019, but after presiding over their worst start to a league season, he returned to playing duties for the rest of the season. In August 2020 he was given the role again on the same day he announced his retirement from playing. In his first season he led them to fourth in the Belgian first division. This campaign he went one better, with the club finishing third. Ahead of their final game of the season with Club Brugge on Sunday, Kompany had cast doubt over his future, telling reporters: ""I will sit down with the board [this summer]. We'll see if the goals for next season are achievable. Shouting about winning is one thing, doing it is another."" Latest Burnley news Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments There had been reports of friction between the manager and the Anderlecht hierarchy after owner Marc Coucke posted on Instagram in April 'How to kill an entire season in 1 week' following a poor start to the play-offs, and defeat in the Belgian Cup final to Gent. As a player, Kompany spent 11 years at the Etihad, making 360 appearances and scoring 20 goals - including a potentially title-winning strike against Leicester City in 2019, which helped the club lift the last of the four Premier League titles they earned during his stay. Jackson had refused to be drawn on whether he wanted to continue in his caretaker role full-time when he spoke to reporters last week, ahead of that final-day defeat to Newcastle which confirmed their relegation. He said: ""I've just not thought about [the job] at all. All my thoughts have been how can we achieve what we want to do. ""We've not spoken about it. We've not had time to even think about that. My full focus has been on trying to achieve this. ""Let's see what happens on Monday morning. Fingers crossed everything goes how we want, then we'll have a good Monday.""

Chelsea,"Wrapping up the Chelsea transfer news, rumours and gossip in the 2022 summer window. Danny Drinkwater has apologised to Chelsea fans for a ""business move gone wrong"" on confirming the end of his five years at Stamford Bridge. Drinkwater's loan stint at Reading finished last week, and the 32-year-old has now announced his official Chelsea departure too. The one-time England midfielder joined the Blues from Leicester for £35million in 2017 but failed to make any telling impact at Stamford Bridge.

The former Manchester United trainee helped Leicester win the league in 2015 but now finds himself a free agent, after four loans in three years to close out his Chelsea tenure.

He said: ""First of all thank you to you fans for sticking by us this season and for continuing to inspire us right until the last day of the season. ""The main goal became to stay in the premier league and I don't believe that would have happened without your unbelievable support. ""Finishing the season on a high meant everything to me, enjoy the break toffee fans you deserve it. May the pressure continue to be a privilege."" Calvert-Lewin is the latest footballer to talk about mental health. In March, Paul Pogba opened up about experiencing depression ""several times"" during his career and said it is difficult for footballers to speak out about their mental health struggles. Last summer, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings revealed he saw a psychologist during England's Euro 2020 campaign because his ""mental health plummeted"". In 2018, Danny Rose talked about his struggles before England travelled to Russia for the World Cup. Earlier this month, Sam Allardyce also spoke about his battles after he was sacked as England manager and highlighted the problems that lower league bosses faced on a day-to-day basis.

Leeds United,"Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Brenden Aaronson has signed for Leeds United on a five-year deal. Sky Sports News understands the 21-year-old has joined for a fee of €29m (£24.7m). The move will be completed on July 1. Aaronson made 41 appearances in all competitions for Salzburg last season, providing 10 assists and scoring six goals, helping the club win the Austrian Bundesliga and Austrian Cup for the second season in succession. Leeds initially tried to sign the USA international in the January transfer window. Aaronson is primarily an attacking midfielder but he is also capable of playing in a range of roles, and it is his versatility that will excite head coach Jesse Marsch. In January 2021, the midfielder completed a move to Red Bull Salzburg from Philadelphia Union for an undisclosed fee, linking up with Marsch, who was in charge of the Austrian outfit at the time. He featured 24 times in all competitions, netting seven goals, helping Marsch and Salzburg win the Austrian league and cup double. Along with completing a second Austrian double last season, Aaronson also played 10 times in the Champions League helping Salzburg reach the last-16 of the tournament.

Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week In the coming weeks he will link up with the USA national team for their matches against Morocco, Uruguay, Grenada and El Salvador. The transfer is subject to the necessary international clearance and a work permit.

""I had to play with my team and give them my all with Red Bull Salzburg and give them all I had for the rest of the season. I was focused on that but also I was looking at the results from Leeds and this last one had me sweating a little bit. ""He [Marsch] was definitely a factor but in general the club was just a massive pull for me. How big, how historic, how the fans are, how the team is, it's a dream place for me.""

Leicester City,"Leicester cruised to a 4-1 win against Southampton at the King Power Stadium on the final day. A goalless first half failed to muster one shot on target and was plagued with mistakes and slips, from a season curtain-closing fixture with nothing but three points on the line for both sides. Despite this, Leicester had the lion's share of quality chances with Jamie Vardy, uncharacteristically, spurning several clear opportunities, almost pouncing on Alex McCarthy dawdling on the ball and failing to connect cleanly with a Timothy Castagne cross. Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Fofana (6), Evans (6), Castagne (7), Justin , Mendy, Dewsbury-Hall, Tielemans, Maddison. (7), Barnes (6), Vardy (7) Subs: Perez (7), Amartey (N/A), Pereira (7), Lookman (6) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Walker-Peters, (6) Lyanco (5), Stephens (6), Romeu (6), Ward-Prowse (6), S. Armstrong (6), Redmond (6), A. Armstrong (6), Salisu (6), Elyounoussi (7) Subs: Long (N/A), Adams (6), Djenepo (6), Smallbone. (N/A) Man of the match: James Maddison However, the deadlock was broken from a route-one long ball from Kasper Schmeichel, but was equally created by calamitous defending from Lyanco - who headed the clearance skyward before attempting to head it back to McCarthy - but the pass fell straight to Vardy, whose rebounded shot landed at the feet of in-form Maddison to cooly finish. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Foxes were well on top when Wesley Fofana made a breakout pass to Harvey Barnes from inside his own box. Barnes broke down the left flank and looked to switch play towards Maddison - but Vardy intercepted, cut inside, composed himself and smashed it low past McCarthy's right-hand side. Southampton were handed a lifeline five minutes later when James Ward-Prowse converted a penalty, but the one-goal deficit lasted merely a minute. Maddison curled in a delightful pass from the left flank with his right foot, which bounced in front of substitute Ayoze Perez, who improvised by jumping to connect with a scissor kick - smashing home his side's third goal. How the teams lined up Match stats Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments Perez sealed the win and a fine cameo appearance with his second goal after fellow substitute Ricardo Pereira found the Spaniard in exactly the same position where he finished his first goal - finishing with equal style and precision to sign the season off in style. ''When you have the ball, you're meant to get it back, but in a way where you can actually do something with it - not with the long ball and Vardy immediately pressing. What is that! ""We had the chance to end up higher, but in the end, we were struggling to get through trials as there were many things going against us. ""For example, injuries, situations like today, decisions against us and in the end this is what we get, 15th position. There's definitely a lot to do in the summer."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers also responded to the controversy that put his team in front: ''I thought it was a little confusing to myself to be honest. ""The players obviously thought that John [Moss] has given us a free-kick. It should be played back to Kasper - he's played a direct ball through. Their centre-half made a mistake and if he heads it back, there's no drama. But he's made a mistake and we capitalised on it. ""Overall it seemed a little confusing, hence the players were unsure of what the decision was. But from that, you have to push on and get the remaining goals and my team did that very well."" The win on the last day of the season meant that Leicester finished eighth in the Premier League - which is the club's fourth-best finish in 46 years, despite the tribulations that the Foxes had to deal with. Rodgers added: ""I think throughout the course of the season, our squad's been decimated with injuries. They've shown great courage to keep going and fight despite the criticism that we've had. ""To finish eighth, it's as high as we could finish, and we wanted to do that. I said four or five games ago that we didn't want to finish with a whimper. The players have certainly not done that. ""They've won three games, drawn our last one against Chelsea and have given us a good foundation for the pre-season and moving into next season.""

Liverpool,"France's sports minister says that Liverpool fans without valid tickets were responsible for initial crowd control problems at the Champions League final, with problems exacerbated later by local youths trying to force their way in to the game. Saturday's game at the Stade de France between Liverpool and Real Madrid kicked off with a 36-minute delay after police tried to hold back people attempting to force their way into the French national stadium without tickets, while some ticket holders complained they were not let in. ""What happened, first of all, was this mass gathering of the British supporters of the Liverpool club, without tickets, or with fake tickets,"" she told French radio RTL on Monday. ""When there are that many people by the entrance to the stadium, there will be people trying to force their way in through the doors of the Stade de France, and a certain number of youths from the nearby area who were present tried to get in by mixing in with the crowd."" UEFA blamed ""thousands of fans with fake tickets"" for causing delays, while UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Liverpool called for a formal investigation into what caused the chaos. Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol was among those who were targeted with tear gas as the chaos continued before the final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player There was ""no obvious justification"" for the kind of behaviour shown by French police in Paris, culture minister Chris Philp has said. Updates: What happened at Stade de France? Download the Sky Sports App Speaking to Sky News, Philp said: ""I was horrified to see those pictures of fans, including some children, disabled fans, being pepper-sprayed by French police. ""And from the pictures I saw there was no obvious justification for that kind of behaviour. So Nadine (Dorries), I think is quite right to call for Uefa to urgently investigate exactly what happened there because we don't want to see football fans, least of all children and disabled fans, being pepper-sprayed by police in the way that we saw. ""So, I really am concerned by it, the government are as well, and we need Uefa to properly investigate exactly what happened and get to the bottom of it."" When asked about suggestions Liverpool football fans did not have tickets and were pushing their way in, Mr Philp said: ""As I say, we need to get this properly looked into so we understand exactly what happened. But as I say, I sawfootage of fans behaving in a perfectly calm way, getting pepper-sprayed, and that just strikes me looking at those pictures as not appropriate."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player When asked why he thought French authorities were blaming Liverpool football fans for the chaos, Labour MP Ian Byrne, who attended the game, told Sky News: ""It's the easy thing to do. ""We're back in 1989 territory where the lies and smears about Hillsborough went out really quickly and that narrative was set. ""When I got into the grounds I was absolutely appalled when I saw the signs saying it was due to the late arrival of fans. ""There were people who had been there three-and-a-half hours who were kettled in, getting pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed - this was a football occasion. ""We've all seen the footage, seen the photographs, and I just thank God this time that the journalists were there, the British journalists have covered it wonderfully well. ""But Uefa and the French authorities need to hang their heads in shame about what happened on Saturday night."" Citing 'unacceptable issues' for supporters, Liverpool had called for a formal investigation to probe what occurred outside the stadium before UEFA released its statement. ""We are hugely disappointed at the stadium entry issues and breakdown of the security perimeter that Liverpool fans faced this evening at Stade de France,"" the club said. ""This is the greatest match in European football and supporters should not have to experience the scenes we have witnessed tonight. ""We have officially requested a formal investigation into the causes of these unacceptable issues."" Culture Secretary Dorries described the scenes outside the Stade de France as ""deeply concerning"" as she joined the Premier League club's calls for UEFA to investigate the events of Saturday evening. ""It is in the interests of everyone involved to understand what happened and to learn lessons from these events,"" she said in a statement. The statement issued by UEFA shortly before the end of the game - in which Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 - said: ""In the lead-up to the game, the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles. ""This created a build-up of fans trying to get in. As a result, the kick-off was delayed by 35 minutes to allow as many fans as possible with genuine tickets to gain access. ""As numbers outside the stadium continued to build up after kick-off, the police dispersed them with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""UEFA is sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the French police and authorities, and with the French Football Federation."" Stadium authorities initially blamed a delayed kick-off on the ""late arrival"" of fans for the showpiece event. That version of events was fiercely disputed by those in attendance in Paris, including Sky Sports journalists and reporters inside the stadium. ""It seems to me that the whole policing operation before this game was ineffective,"" Solhekol concluded. ""It was not done properly."" An announcement posted on the big screens inside the Stade de France initially blamed fans for the kick-off delay, with the message reading: ""Due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium, the match has been delayed."" But Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy countered: ""Supporters have been queuing for over two hours outside. There are countless witness accounts of how this evening has unfolded amid horrid organisation."" Reddy had already tweeted almost 40 minutes before the scheduled kick-off time of 8pm: ""Reports from those stuck outside the stadium - and footage feeding through as well - of poor organisation and communication, dangerously narrow routes with police vans further unnecessarily blocking space. All of it creating an uncomfortable, unwanted situation."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports presenter Kelly Cates, attending the final as a supporter, had also tweeted: ""Absolutely shambolic at the Stade de France. No way in, no way of knowing which way to go. Stay safe if you're heading in... It has the potential to be very dangerous."" Former England captain Gary Lineker posted: ""I'm not sure it's possible to have a more poorly organised event if you tried. Absolutely shambolic and dangerous."" Ahead of kick-off, some fans were filmed scaling the outside perimeter of the Stade de France to gain access. The Associated Press reported 'sporadic instances of fans, apparently without tickets, breaking through security and attempting to get into the stadium'. The agency reported seeing two fans - one wearing Liverpool attire - wrestled to the ground by stewards and bundled out of the gates. Another fan evaded stewards and was seen sprinting through the concourse and into the bottom level of the stadium. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol at the Stade de France ""In the last few minutes, me and three of my crew were tear-gassed for no reason whatsoever by the French police. It was a pretty nasty experience but we sorted it out by getting a few bottles of water and pouring it in our eyes. We are all fine. ""The situation here is a bit of a strange one. I think what has happened is a lot of people have turned up at the stadium without tickets. They seem to be young, French people just milling around and trying to break through the security cordons. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""From what I've seen, even at the Liverpool fan park, the French police's attitude has been very heavy-handed with absolutely zero tolerance. They don't care how much of a crush is developing and they are insisting on searching absolutely everybody before they let them through. ""We had a situation at the fan park this afternoon where some Liverpool fans were queuing up for three hours to get into a free event. There were three, four, five checkpoints where they were being held up and searched. ""We had the same situation at the stadium tonight. There are so many police, riot police and security guards here and their mindset has been to stop anybody without a ticket getting anywhere near the stadium. ""The situation is complicated because we're not just talking about paper tickets, we're talking about in the modern age, people have passes on their phones. They haven't been able to bring up the right passes or find their passwords. We've seen people in tears because they've had their tickets swiped from them. People have had their electronic tickets stolen from them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""As far as the police and security here [at the Stade de France] are concerned, they don't care. They don't want anybody near the stadium if they don't have tickets. I'm walking around the streets now and it's full of young, French people trying to find a way to get inside the security cordon. ""I can only say from what I've seen as an eyewitness myself, but I haven't seen any Liverpool supporters whatsoever causing any problem at all. I haven't seen them turning up late, I was quite shocked at how early supporters had turned up at the stadium. ""We got here about four hours before kick-off, expecting it to be quite quiet. But it felt like it was an hour before kick-off because so many people had arrived early and in good time. I would be very wary when I read statements from UEFA blaming the kick-off being delayed and the problems outside the stadium on the late arrival of fans. That is not the case from what I have seen. ""I have seen quite a few fans trying to trick their way past security guards and the policemen and all of those supporters I've seen trying to do that are Spanish. It was one of those incidents we got caught up in when we were tear-gassed, a group of riot police were trying to eject some Real Madrid supporters who were trying to get through the cordon without tickets. ""There was a bit of a confrontation between the Spanish supporters and the riot police, and that's when they got out the tear gas and we happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""But I have to stress again - with my own eyes, I haven't seen any Liverpool supporters causing any problems or trouble whatsoever."" Merseyside Police say they will pass on their observations from Saturday's Champions League final chaos after Liverpool requested a formal investigation from UEFA. Officers from Merseyside were deployed in France to work with local officers, and ""they have reported the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner"". Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said: Our officers returning today will conduct a formal debrief to ensure that we can fully support any subsequent investigation following last night's game. ""We know that people would have witnessed a lot of distressing scenes last night and we wish everyone returning home from Paris a safe journey. Our focus today will be supporting Liverpool city council with the policing of the homecoming parade."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Manchester United,"Ralf Rangnick will not stay on in his consultancy role at Manchester United next season. The German, who took interim charge of United in November, says he has made the decision due to the demands of his new role as Austria manager. Rangnick guided United to their worst season in the Premier League era, as they finished the campaign in sixth with 58 points and zero goal difference. A club statement read: ""We would like to thank Ralf Rangnick for his efforts as interim manager over the past six months. ""By mutual agreement, Ralf will now focus solely on his new role as manager of the Austria national team and will not therefore be taking up a consultancy role at Old Trafford.

Sky Sports' Zinny Boswell: A lot of excitement surrounded Ralf Rangnick's arrival. His work developing an exciting, modern, high-pressing style of football at the Red Bull group and Hoffenheim imbued a sense of hope and optimism at United after a collapse under his predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He was something different. But the Rangnick experiment didn't work. Top four still felt like a possibility when he first arrived, but under the German this side has fallen to United's worst season in the Premier League era. He admits that too many compromises were made to incorporate Cristiano Ronaldo - ""he's not a pressing monster"", the German admitted - and he put United's other less-defensively motivated forwards into a system that hasn't reflected his philosophy. Rangnick says he and his staff must share the blame. Aside from his obvious failings on the pitch, Rangnick has brought a fresh perspective to Old Trafford. Solskjaer sought to deal with any problems behind closed doors, keeping the media at arm's length, while Rangnick was transparent in his offerings. His honesty has shone a light on some of the biggest problems at United, leaving no one in any doubt about the task ahead of incoming manager Erik ten Hag.

The Magpies finished the campaign with a 2-1 win at Burnley to lift them to a 11th in the Premier League table with 49 points.

Norwich City,"Tottenham have qualified for next season’s Champions League after a 5-0 win at already-relegated Norwich secured fourth place ahead of Arsenal. Tottenham started the final day fourth in the table knowing they only needed a draw to qualify for European football's elite club competition. But Antonio Conte's side eased to a comfortable win at Carrow Road as Heung-Min Son scored twice in the second half to share the Golden Boot with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah as they both finished on 23 goals. Dejan Kulusevski also scored twice either side of Harry Kane's header to ensure Tottenham will return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2019/20 campaign. The win over the Premier League's bottom side means Tottenham finished two points above north London rivals Arsenal. Any final-day nerves for Spurs were eased in the 16th minute as Kulusevski gave the visitors the lead. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's clipped ball played in Rodrigo Bentancur, who beat the offside trap to race in on goal and square for Kulusevski to tap in from close range. How the teams lined up Match stats Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments The home side came close to equalising but Milot Rashica's low shot went wide of Hugo Lloris' post, with the Kosovan's effort Norwich's best chance of the match. Kane then made it 2-0 to Spurs in the 32nd minute thanks to a mistake from Norwich goalkeeper Tim Krul. Trying to play out from the back, the Dutchman hit his pass straight to Bentancur, who crossed for an unmarked Kane to nod home into an empty net. In the 64th minute, Spurs made the game safe as Kulusevski scored his second with a stunning strike. Set free by Kane, he outmuscled Dimitris Giannoulis and then curled a sensational left-footed shot into the far corner. Son then drew level with Mohamad Salah in the Golden Boot race on 22 goals in the 70th minute, as he struck a low finish past Krul from a clever first-time ball from substitute Lucas Moura. The South Korean went one clear of Salah five minutes later with a sublime finish from outside the box but the Liverpool forward scored at Anfield against Wolves shortly after to ensure the award was shared. But Salah's late goal was the only blemish on a fine afternoon for Spurs who ran riot at Norwich to return to the Champions League after two seasons away, with the future looking bright under Antonio Conte.

""Sometimes it's not only when you lift a trophy to be satisfied. I think we reached the maximum level that we dreamed of in November because then the situation was not so good for many reasons. The club changed the coach and with injuries we tried to find the good solution. ""I think we've done a really good job and for me this is a big achievement in a league that is very difficult because here you find the best players and best coaches. ""I'm happy even though I didn't lift any trophy this season."" On Son sharing the Golden Boot, Conte said: ""It's a magnificent achievement for him. I think Sonny felt a bit of pressure to reach this achievement but we are very happy for him. ""Today we had two targets: the first was to get into the Champions League and then to try to help Sonny to become top scorer and so we're very happy."" Heung-Min Son speaking to Sky Sports on sharing the Golden Boot: ""I'm really happy. It feels amazing. When I saw it [the award] for the first time I felt a little bit emotional because when I was a kid I dreamed of it. When I got it in my hands I still don't believe it. ""It's an unbelievable achievement but I'm really grateful for my team-mates, the fans and the coaching staff for helping me. ""There was always space to improve and everyone believed that but as soon as the new manager came everything has been changed. It was incredible. There is no secret, I think it's always hard work and to believe in ourselves. ""I can't wait to get started next season.""

There were too many individual errors that costs us goals. ""We had good moments in the game but we don't take our chances.

The 22-year-old had an outstanding match as he opened the scoring to settle the nerves and then made the game safe in the second half with a stunning strike. Kulusevski has been a star since signing in January and once again he was pivotal in the team's forward play as he constantly stretched the Norwich defence and was at the heart of every Spurs attack.

Southampton,"Leicester cruised to a 4-1 win against Southampton at the King Power Stadium on the final day. A goalless first half failed to muster one shot on target and was plagued with mistakes and slips, from a season curtain-closing fixture with nothing but three points on the line for both sides. Despite this, Leicester had the lion's share of quality chances with Jamie Vardy, uncharacteristically, spurning several clear opportunities, almost pouncing on Alex McCarthy dawdling on the ball and failing to connect cleanly with a Timothy Castagne cross. Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Fofana (6), Evans (6), Castagne (7), Justin , Mendy, Dewsbury-Hall, Tielemans, Maddison. (7), Barnes (6), Vardy (7) Subs: Perez (7), Amartey (N/A), Pereira (7), Lookman (6) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Walker-Peters, (6) Lyanco (5), Stephens (6), Romeu (6), Ward-Prowse (6), S. Armstrong (6), Redmond (6), A. Armstrong (6), Salisu (6), Elyounoussi (7) Subs: Long (N/A), Adams (6), Djenepo (6), Smallbone. (N/A) Man of the match: James Maddison However, the deadlock was broken from a route-one long ball from Kasper Schmeichel, but was equally created by calamitous defending from Lyanco - who headed the clearance skyward before attempting to head it back to McCarthy - but the pass fell straight to Vardy, whose rebounded shot landed at the feet of in-form Maddison to cooly finish. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Foxes were well on top when Wesley Fofana made a breakout pass to Harvey Barnes from inside his own box. Barnes broke down the left flank and looked to switch play towards Maddison - but Vardy intercepted, cut inside, composed himself and smashed it low past McCarthy's right-hand side. Southampton were handed a lifeline five minutes later when James Ward-Prowse converted a penalty, but the one-goal deficit lasted merely a minute. Maddison curled in a delightful pass from the left flank with his right foot, which bounced in front of substitute Ayoze Perez, who improvised by jumping to connect with a scissor kick - smashing home his side's third goal. How the teams lined up Match stats Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments Perez sealed the win and a fine cameo appearance with his second goal after fellow substitute Ricardo Pereira found the Spaniard in exactly the same position where he finished his first goal - finishing with equal style and precision to sign the season off in style. ''When you have the ball, you're meant to get it back, but in a way where you can actually do something with it - not with the long ball and Vardy immediately pressing. What is that! ""We had the chance to end up higher, but in the end, we were struggling to get through trials as there were many things going against us. ""For example, injuries, situations like today, decisions against us and in the end this is what we get, 15th position. There's definitely a lot to do in the summer."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers also responded to the controversy that put his team in front: ''I thought it was a little confusing to myself to be honest. ""The players obviously thought that John [Moss] has given us a free-kick. It should be played back to Kasper - he's played a direct ball through. Their centre-half made a mistake and if he heads it back, there's no drama. But he's made a mistake and we capitalised on it. ""Overall it seemed a little confusing, hence the players were unsure of what the decision was. But from that, you have to push on and get the remaining goals and my team did that very well."" The win on the last day of the season meant that Leicester finished eighth in the Premier League - which is the club's fourth-best finish in 46 years, despite the tribulations that the Foxes had to deal with. Rodgers added: ""I think throughout the course of the season, our squad's been decimated with injuries. They've shown great courage to keep going and fight despite the criticism that we've had. ""To finish eighth, it's as high as we could finish, and we wanted to do that. I said four or five games ago that we didn't want to finish with a whimper. The players have certainly not done that. ""They've won three games, drawn our last one against Chelsea and have given us a good foundation for the pre-season and moving into next season.""

Tottenham Hotspur,"Ivan Perisic is in London to undergo a medical at Tottenham. The 33-year-old, who can play as a wing-back and a forward, is set to sign a two-year contract and become one of Antonio Conte's first signings of the summer window. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster has also agreed to sign for Spurs when his deal at Southampton expires and has already completed his medical exams. The Croatia international, who has 113 caps for his country and scored in the 2018 World Cup final, has been at Inter since 2015. He won Serie A last season under Tottenham head coach Conte after spending the 2019-20 season on loan at Bayern Munich where he lifted the Champions League. Despite speculation around his Spurs future, Conte is preparing for next season at the club after talks with managing director of football Fabio Paratici on Friday. Conte has been told the club aim to sign at least six or seven players, as Spurs look to back the Italian in the transfer market. Spurs are targeting several areas, with goalkeeper, centre back, wing-back, central midfielder and striker among the positions they plan to strengthen. Conte deployed Perisic at left wing-back during his time at Inter after bringing him back into the fold. Latest Tottenham news Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week Sky Sports News assistant news editor Lyall Thomas: ""It's not often Tottenham make investments in players over 30, let alone at 33 - but on a free transfer this one makes sense. ""First of all he is someone Antonio Conte wants, having worked with him before at Inter Milan, so he is a great way of showing backing for the manager early in the window. ""But from a football perspective, it makes even more sense. Perisic is experienced, right at the top of the game. He's a winner. He's won the Champions League with Bayern Munich and the Serie A title under Conte in 2021. ""He is also still at the top of his game, despite his age, and can offer a threat from a variety of positions. Conte converted him into a left wing-back in their title-winning side but he can also provide cover and competition for Heung-Min Son and Dejan Kulusevski in the forward positions. ""Conte wants to add experienced heads to his squad to get Tottenham competing on all fronts next season and Perisic will bring that in abundance."" Sky Sports News reporter Paul Gilmour: ""Following the news that Tottenham have put in £150m of equity funds into the club, the club are clearly backing Antonio Conte in the transfer market this summer. ""They will target several positions including goalkeeper, centre back, wing-back, central midfielder and a striker. As many as six or seven players could arrive. They will need to find the right balance with homegrown players. There is currently an imbalance in this area. ""Conte wants more depth in the squad, and he also wants to add experienced players, a shift from recent times when Spurs targeted younger players. ""There are some at the club who feel it's inaccurate they didn't spend in the past but there is an acknowledgement they didn't always get recruitment right. ""Fabio Paratici can do no wrong at the club currently. Additions of Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski have given belief that they are finally getting it right in this area. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Extensive homework is being carried out on player ability and character. Spurs recently rejected the chance to sign one talented Premier League player because their research highlighted concerns he could be a disruptive influence."" Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has heaped praise on head coach Conte for delivering Champions League football for Tottenham next season. Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, the former Manchester United defender said: ""We were at the North London Derby 10 days ago and even if Arsenal had beaten Newcastle, I still think Antonio Conte would have stayed because of what he experienced that night. Where are you going to get this competitive element, these atmospheres in Europe at this moment in time? You're not. ""He's done a brilliant job at Tottenham, he's been assisted by the capitulation of Manchester United and the fall of Arsenal but he's done a good job and was always going to. I'm very clear that he isn't the right manager for Manchester United but you can say someone's not the right manager for your club but he's still a great manager. ""The others have got Tuchel, Conte, Klopp and Guardiola - they're animals, they win trophies all the time. They stand on the touchline and can almost eat you alive with their presence and aura. The rest have a long way to go."" Who will be on the move this summer when the transfer window opens on June 10 and closes at 11pm on September 1?

Watford,"Ross Barkley came off the bench to head in a late winner as Chelsea saw off Watford on the final day of the Premier League season and sent Roy Hodgson into retirement on the back of another defeat. There was little on the line for either side ahead of kick-off, with Chelsea guaranteed third place - barring a defeat and a monumental goal difference swing by Tottenham - and Watford already consigned to the Championship. That feeling was backed up by each team's starting line-ups, with Chelsea handing Saul Niguez a rare start and Kenedy being brought in for his first league start for the club in five years. Roy Hodgson was also feeling generous, making six changes to the Watford side that was thrashed at home by Leicester last weekend. It was Chelsea who started brighter, with Kenedy in particular looking keen to take his opportunity, and the Brazilian wing-back claimed the assist for the opening goal when his low cross from the left was turned home by an unmarked Kai Havertz (11). The Blues have never lost at home to Watford in the Premier League and looked set to go on to dominate a side that had lost 26 of their 37 league games. However, the hosts rarely threatened Daniel Bachmann's goal and it was the visitors who looked more like scoring as Thomas Tuchel's side went off the boil. How the teams lined up Match stats Premier League table Get NOW to stream big moments Edo Kayembe went close for the Hornets after errors from Reece James and Edouard Mendy, while the Chelsea goalkeeper had to make an impressive save early in the second half after Joao Pedro waltzed through the Blues' defence. In truth, Chelsea's supporters seemed more concerned with events at the Etihad, where they greeted each Manchester City goal as if it was one of their own as they hoped to see Liverpool pipped to the title. The home fans were also in full voice to send off Antonio Rudiger, who was replaced by Barkley in the second half in his final appearance for the club before joining Real Madrid, and to welcome Ben Chilwell, who came on as a late substitute for his first appearance in seven months after recovering from a serious knee injury. But it was the Watford fans who were making all the noise shortly after when Gosling stole in at the far post to nod home a left-wing cross from Adam Masina, who was given far too much space to pick out his team-mate (87). It looked like being a familiar tale for Chelsea, who came into the game on the back of just one home win in their last five league visits to Stamford Bridge, but Barkley was on hand to ensure the Blues ended the season on a winning note when his header from James' cross squirmed past Daniel Bachmann in the Watford goal (90). Chelsea's season has been a tough one to evaluate, with the sanctions placed on the club overshadowing events on the field in recent months. Thomas Tuchel's side also lost on penalties to a generational Liverpool side in successive cup finals and, while they won the European Super Cup and Club World Cup, failed to come close to lifting the Premier League or Champions League. As such, Chelsea's successes this season can perhaps be seen in the progress of a handful of their younger players on the field, including Kai Havertz and Mason Mount, who was crowned as the club's player of the year on the pitch at full time. But perhaps the biggest improvement has come from Reece James, who once again was crucial for the Blues as they salvaged an all-too-rare home win against Watford. The England international's versatility was again utilised by Tuchel, as he began the game at wing-back before moving to full-back when the head coach switched his formation in the second half. But his defensive responsibilities didn't prevent James from making his way to the byline as the game headed towards full-time, where he twisted his man inside out before digging out a cross with the outside of his foot that perfectly found Barkley at the far post. James ends the season with nine Premier League assists - more than twice as many as in his previous two campaigns combined. A sign of the 22-year-old's creativity is that only Liverpool duo Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson recorded more assists during the campaign. No matter what happens to Chelsea's squad this summer, it is sure that James will be a key pillar in the seasons ahead. Chelsea: Mendy (7), Azpilicueta (6), Silva (7), Rudiger (6), James (7), Kante (6), Saul (5), Kenedy (7), Ziyech (6), Havertz (7), Mount (7). Subs: Sarr (6), Barkley (7), Chilwell (6). Watford: Bachmann (6), Femenia (6), Kabasele (6), Samir (6), Kamara (6), Sissoko (6), Cleverley (7), Kayembe (7), Sema (6), Pedro (7), King (6). Subs: Hernandez (6), Masina (7), Gosling (7). Man of the match: Reece James Thomas Tuchel says he has no time to reward himself with a holiday after Chelsea's arduous campaign across six competitions as he believes the Blues must begin a ""rebuild"" of their squad this summer. Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen will both leave Stamford Bridge on free transfers at their end of their contracts, while there are questions over a number of players' futures, including Cesar Azpilicueta, Jorginho and N'Golo Kante. Chelsea are waiting for Todd Boehly's takeover of the club to be finalised before they can once again operate in the transfer market, and Tuchel says the delay caused by the sanctions have left them playing catch up with their rivals. ""No, it's impossible to go on holiday. There's too many things to clarify,"" Tuchel said. ""The disadvantage in terms of timing for the rebuild is big and we have to be fast and smart. It's a rebuild that is necessary for us and it makes things more challenging. ""We have clear ideas for the profiles and the characteristics of these players, but it's not like you put a name on the list and then you get the player. You have to convince the player, you have to speak to other clubs. So there's normally a lot of work to do."" Tuchel was also asked about moving away from his tried and tested three-at-the-back formation in the wake of departures in his defence, but he said: ""I think the structure suits our players very well. It suits Reece James and Ben Chilwell very well because they have a bit more freedom to attack on both sides. ""There were some reasons to play this structure and we were very successful, so it's not the plan to change it. But maybe we are forced to - we are forced to be passive."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Roy Hodgson has pledged to end a managerial career that spanned five decades now that Watford's season is over, and he said their narrow defeat at Chelsea was ""typical"" of his side's fortune since he arrived at Vicarage Road in January. The 74-year-old won just two of his 18 matches in charge, and he said: ""Today was typical I thought, to do so well throughout and get a very good goal that equalises, it would have been nice if the players could have got that reward for their efforts and come off with a point. ""As it is, they come out once again with a defeat, albeit a very honourable one considering we've been relegated for a while now."" Hodgson insisted he had no regrets about taking the Watford job, despite the fact he has now ended his career with relegation. ""I'm happy with the decision because I took it with my eyes wide open and I thought it was the right thing to do. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out, but that doesn't mean I'm now looking back with regret."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm"
West Ham United,"West Ham are not looking to sell midfielder Tomas Soucek this summer amid reports they were listening to offers for him. Sky Sports News understands the 27-year-old remains an integral part of manager David Moyes' plans moving forward. The Czech Republic international has two years left on his contract with the option of a further year. Soucek has been a key part of West Ham's success under Moyes since signing in January 2020, initially on a loan deal from Slavia Prague. He joined the Hammers permanently in July 2020 for a fee of £15m, on top of the £4m loan fee Slavia had already received.

Wolverhampton Wanderers,"Liverpool finished a memorable domestic season with a 3-1 win over Wolves at Anfield - although on a rollercoaster of a final day, that wasn't quite enough to turn the title race, with Manchester City eventually beating Aston Villa at the Etihad 3-2 to be crowned champions by a point. The Reds never hit top spot but incredibly looked primed to go on and pull off a historic triumph when they were level on points with City, after recovering from Pedro Neto's shock opener with a Sadio Mane strike and Villa going 2-0 up in Manchester. With Philippe Coutinho on the scoresheet at the Etihad and Steven Gerrard in the dugout as Villa boss, it seemed Liverpool's old guard were delivering the favours the Reds' supporters had dreamed of. Anfield was electric at that point but City brilliantly fought back to win the race for the crown. Golden-boot winner Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson struck late on to ensure it was at least victory on the pitch for Liverpool, with their supporters paying tribute to a side which has lifted the Carabao Cup and FA Cup this season and closed what was once a 14-point deficit with two games in hand on City in January with a remarkable 19-game unbeaten run. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It was also some send off for a Liverpool team who now look ahead to Saturday's Champions League final with Real Madrid in Paris, where more glory and silverware beckons, although the unprecedented quadruple is now out of their reach. The win means Liverpool finish their Premier League campaign with 92 points, enough to win the title in 24 of the previous 29 seasons, while 23-goal Salah shared the top scorer prize with Heung-Min Son of Tottenham and Alisson finished tied with City's Ederson for the golden glove with 20 shutouts. Premier League table How the teams lined up Match stats Get NOW to stream big moments The victory also secures an unbeaten season at home for Liverpool, for the fourth time in five years, with Wolves losing an 11th Premier League game in a row against the Reds. Bruno Lage's side have failed to win any of their final seven matches but finish 10th, with six points more than last season. Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7),Konate (5), Matip (5), Robertson (7), Thiago (7), Keita (6), Henderson (7), Diaz (7), Mane (8), Jota (6) Subs: Milner (6), Salah (7), Firmino (6) Wolves: Sa (6), Boly (7), Coady (7), Toti (6), Jonny (6), Moutinho (6), Dendoncker (6), Neves (6), Ait-Nouri (6), Neto (7), Jimenez (7) Subs: Hwang (6), Ruddy (5), Trincao (N/A) Man of the match: Sadio Mane A fog of red flares had greeted the team buses outside Anfield before kick-off but Wolves hadn't read the script, with Raul Jimenez exploiting a gaping space left by Ibrahima Konate to cross for Neto to slot in a shock opener for the visitors. It was the Wolves' supporters turn to be heard, with a gold flare delaying the re-start. Liverpool's response was unsurprisingly intense, with Joel Matip heading wide and Luis Diaz seeing a penalty shout waved away before crossing through the six-yard box. But Leander Dendoncker exposed the hosts' defence again and should have made it 2-0 when Matip gave the ball away on halfway. An injury to Neto on 20 minutes was a major blow for Wolves given the problems he'd caused early on and Liverpool were back level moments after he was subbed off, with a wonderful flick from Thiago sending Mane through to slot in his 16th of the season. ""That's out of this world from Thiago,"" said Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher. Robertson volleyed over and Thiago shot wide as Liverpool pressed for a second and the atmosphere hit a whole new level when news of Matty Cash's opener for Aston Villa at Man City filtered through. But still the Reds looked vulnerable, with Alisson having to save from sub Hwang Hee-Chan. Thiago was forced off with injury on the stroke of half-time and replaced by James Milner but Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa also needed to be changed at the break, with John Ruddy coming on. The replacement shot-stopper was beaten inside five minutes, with Mane slotting home again, although VAR spotted a clear offside. Liverpool continued to pile forwards, with a fierce Diaz strike decking Conor Coady, and Salah was sent on to bolster the attack. Trent Alexander-Arnold drew a good stop from Ruddy and a superb tackle from Willy Boly denied Salah. News of Coutinho's goal sent Liverpool hands onto Liverpool heads in disbelief. It was on - they just needed a goal. An Alexander-Arnold's drive was blocked as Liverpool continued to bang at the door. But then it all changed around, with Ilkay Gundogan, Rodri, and then Gundgoan again unbelievably switching the title race back into City's favour with a three-goal salvo. Salah grabbed his golden-boot sharing goal to give Liverpool hope - and there were celebrations when a false report of a Villa equaliser spread around the stadium. However, by the time Robertson made it 3-1 there was an acceptance Liverpool were going to fall just short in this race. But two out of three trophies ain't bad. And if they can make it three out of four on Saturday, then this will really be a special season to remember. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: ""The boys have played an incredible season. The whole journey. Its absolutely exceptional. The game today said so much about these boys. We conceded an early goal which gave us a knock. We didn't play football like we usually play. We had to take Thiago off early. And then you still find a way, it's outstanding. Ninety-two points is crazy. ""It was clear before the game a lot of things had to happen [for Liverpool to win the title]. Congratulations to Man City, Pep Guardiola, their players. We were close but in the end not close enough. ""Thiago is not good but I can't say more. He was outside with his family with his little girl on his shoulders so he could walk which was a good sign. We want to wait until we know more about it. ""I wasn't really aware of [the City score changes]. In my mind it was 1-0. I don't know all the story. There was one moment when it was 3-2 then I don't know why we thought they'd equalised again. That was a good moment ! But then everyone went, 'ah nothing happened'. ""The season was so close, so tight. Moments, decisions, these kind of things. What I've learnt about life is if you stay on track and keep going you get your rewards. Not today, but we will get it. ""This season is incredible and will end next week. It's tough. The early goal didn't help. We have five days to prepare for the Champions League final. We face an incredibly experienced team but that's OK. Losing the league today increased the desire to put it right next week."" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson: ""It was a tough afternoon. We didn't play particularly well or as well as we can. We went a goal behind and it was never easy, there were a few nerves today. We came through really well, scored some good goals and found a way to win. I didn't know what the score was [at Man City] and there were too many cheers from our fans and the Wolves fans. I lost count! We tried to focus on what we needed to do and win the game. ""We have been in this position before. It is tough when you're hearing cheers and Wolves are a good side and we knew they would make it difficult. We always believe that we can find a way and we certainly found a way to get three points. It wasn't enough. The lads have given everything and you cant give too many issues. We've given everything all season right until the last day. Even in January you would have taken your hand off to take it until the last day. ""I've been proud of what they've done this season so far, but it's not over yet. We've got disappointment today and we have to say congratulations to City of course. But then we need to focus on the job next week against a really good side and we'll have to be at our very best to come away with the trophy."" Wolves boss Bruno Lage: ""I'm proud of them. It was a big opportunity to live a good moment. We didn't have a target and it was one more test. We showed personality with the ball. ""When you look back all the little things that happen in the season happened today: players have to come [off], we start winning the game, we have chances to score more goals and in the end we lose it. We give the image we need to be more consistent. ""I need to be honest with my players and say we did a good season. We faced a lot of problems but we put Wolves in the fight for a different position in February and March. In the last games we didn't have what we needed to replace some of the players we played the last six games without."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.
